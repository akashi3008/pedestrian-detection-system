# Pedestrian Perception System

End-to-end pedestrian perception project covering:
1. Dataset preparation and validation
2. Pedestrian detection using YOLOv8
3. Multi-object pedestrian tracking using ByteTrack

Each folder represents a distinct stage of a real-world perception pipeline,
similar to those used in ADAS and autonomous driving systems.
